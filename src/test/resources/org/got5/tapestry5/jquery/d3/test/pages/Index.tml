	<h1> Short presentation </h1>
	
	<p>
	The aim of this project is to integrate d3js with tapestry
	through components.
	Here are some very basic samples, but it can be improved easily.
	The mecanism is the following:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>AbstractD3Component is the parent of any other component</li>
		<li>AbstractD3Component import d3js.js and a default stylesheet</li>
		<li>It also generate the div element in which graphics will be rendered</li>
		<li>Custom components inherits from AbstractD3Component</li>
		<li>They provide a dataset, some parameters (if any), as well as a new tapestry initializer which is responsible to generate graphics</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h1>Samples</h1>
	
	<p>
	Here are basic samples (view below), but the mechanism described above allows to integrate
	any other d3js component easily.
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a t:type="pageLink" page="barChartPage">Simple BarChart component</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a t:type="pageLink" page="groupedBarChartPage">Grouped Bar chart component</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a t:type="pageLink" page="pieChartPage">Pie chart component</a>
		</li>
		<li>Line Chart component</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>More</h1>
	
	<p>
	The previous examples are based on d3js only. 
	These components inherits from the higher parent component, 
	and are so able to generateany d3 component, not only charts.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, there are several interesting js libraries based on top of d3 and specialized in charts.
	The problem is that actually, none of them contain all kinds of charts we would want, and especially the Pie Chart.
	Here are the most interesting ones at this time:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="http://tenxer.github.io/xcharts/">xCharts</a>
		</li>
		<li>
		<a href="http://dimplejs.org/">dimple</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h1>Dimple samples</h1>
	
	<p>
	To create new dimple components, just inherit AbstractDimpleComponent.
	The mechanism is exactly the same than inheriting of AbstractD3Component.
	</p>
	
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a t:type="pageLink" page="dimpleBarChartPage">Bar Chart component</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a t:type="pageLink" page="dimpleGroupedBarChartPage">Grouped Bar Chart component</a>
		</li>		
	</ul>
	
	<h1>Some limitations</h1>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			No native solution to print graphics/charts on the server side. For svg graphics, workarounds can be implemented on client side.
		</li>
		<li>
			Works fine with opera, safari, chrome, firefox, but not with IE 8 (and lower).
		</li>
	</ul>
